A single-issue, 5-stage pipelined processor implementing select RV32-I and -M instructions. Co-developed with another student in my EEC180 class at UC Davis for the final project. Developed using the Intel Quartus Lite environment, and tested on an Altera MAX-10 FPGA. The processor was tested using a simple integer matrix multiplication algorithm written in the Venus RISC-V simulator extension for VSCode.
